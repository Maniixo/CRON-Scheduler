The system is designed to read from the "Many Service [TimeExceded].txt" file.


To add another service, this format must be followed: 

1) Identifier: "uniqueIdentifier"
2) ExpectedTime: (number)[sec/min/hr]
3) SchedulerTime: (number)[sec/min/hr]
4) ****

line 4 is a MUST in order to run the service written before it.
After adding service in the txt file, create another txt file named after the Identifier of the service and write the function that will be executed and call it.
Examples are given in those txt files in the project.  


After running the test_serviceInput, the console will wait for the user to hit [q], this will kill the console application.
The application will print a message to confirm closing the program, then no more services will start, and the services that already started will finish then the program will close.
The project then will create a log file named after each service's Identifier, this txt file will log every movement of the service such as when did it started,
when it finish and so on.
